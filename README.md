# Predicting Loan Default

This project classifies whether a borrower will default on a loan based on their financial history and credit attributes using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset includes borrower information with various financial and personal attributes. The goal is to predict the binary target column `Default` (1 = Defaulted, 0 = No Default).

### Columns include:
- `Age`: Age of the borrower  
- `Income`: Annual income  
- `LoanAmount`: Amount of loan requested  
- `CreditScore`: Credit score value  
- `Education`: Education level  
- `EmploymentType`: Type of employment  
- `MaritalStatus`: Marital status  
- `HasMortgage`: Whether borrower has a mortgage  
- `HasDependents`: Presence of dependents  
- `LoanPurpose`: Purpose of the loan  
- `HasCoSigner`: Whether the loan has a co-signer  
- `Default`: **Target column** (1 = defaulted, 0 = not defaulted)
